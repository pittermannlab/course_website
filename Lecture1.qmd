## Plants are important

-   Plants are the foundation of life and human existence

-   We depend on them for survival, in otherwise lifeless space

-   We ourselves are shaped by milions of years of interactions with plants

## Plants are important

-   Plants are a source of energy: humanity is dependent on photosynthesis

-   Plants have no voice of their own; we take them for granted

-   Modern life has obscured the direct connection to plants

## Plants are the furniture backdrop of most people's lives {text-align="center"}

## About your assignments

## How I want you to think:

-   Example: What is the impact of elevated temperatures on trees?

## The use of generative AI

-   I cannot and will not police you
-   AI will cheat you in the long run
-   You must be able to express yourself clearly on tests

## Come to lectures and sections

-   Best and most direct way to learn
-   Hundreds of dollars per lecture
-   Lecture material will be posted prior to lecture

## Great questions to ask

-   What does that mean?
-   What is the connection between X and Y?
-   Can you explain?
-   Please repeat.
-   What if...? Do you know...? Could it be that...?

# Lecture 1: Plants, diversity, vegetation distribution across the globe

# WHAT IS A PLANT? {.scrollable}

<!-- from How plants work -->

-   Plants are multicellular photosynthetic organisms that have adapted to life on land.
-   They use energy from the sun to turn carbon dioxide into sugars: autotrophs
-   Some plants have adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.
-   Some of the most important autotrophs are not plants at all but algae!

## How did plants evolve? {.smaller}

## Evolutionary adaptations to life on land

# Reproductive innovations were critical

-   no water required for reproduction: pollination evolved!
-   seeds are desiccation-tolerant

# Global vegetation biomes {background-video="cottonwood_movie.mov" background-video-loop="true" background-video-muted="true" background-opacity="0.3"}

What is a Plant?

```         
- Multicellular photosynthetic organisms adapted to land
- They use sunlight to turn CO₂ into sugars (autotrophs)
- Adapted to a wide range of habitat
```

Plant Anatomy & Physiology

```         
- Core tissues facilitate structure, water transport and photosynthesis.
- Photosynthesis and water transport are intertwined.
```

Plant Diversity and Evolution

```         
- Bryophytes: Earliest spore-dispersing plants (liverworts, hornworts, mosses).
- Fern Allies: Vascular plants with simple leaves (lycopods, horsetails, whisk ferns).
- Ferns: Diverse vascular plants with true leaves, prominent in Carboniferous swamps.
- Gymnosperms: Seed-producing plants (gingko, cycads, conifers) from the Mesozoic era.
- Angiosperms: Flowering plants with complex reproduction involving pollinators and seed dispersers.
```

Evolutionary Innovations

```

```

## Suggested study questions

-   How do plants transport water?
-   How does photosynthesis work?
-   What are some innovations of plant life on land?
-   What governs vegetation distribution around the globe?
